        <p>
            " Low Self-esteem ", is a disease that most youngsters are affected with irrespective of what background they are from,
             reasons may vary and even in some cases, there is no reliable reason for itself.
              And I'm also one of them and deep down in my heart I have a realization that I know what is the reason. 
11 Jan 2024, 4 o'clock in the morning, we were sitting at the beach, glancing at the waves, 
listening to the music of the waves, and conversing about the fact when poets wrote about the magical effect of waves,
 they are right though, everything is making sense now. She was looking at the waves, her eyes were sparkling with happiness and her mouth was a little open like she was drinking the air as Nectar. 
 The happiness that this sea brought to her was having a magnificent effect on her body, her beauty was touching peaks of it, I hadn't encountered such a beautiful creation in my life, her beauty was giving a feeling of divine, I was out of conscious, my conscious completely embodied in her beauty, 
 the saliva on her lips making them glitter like diamonds due to reflection of the moonlight. I grab my hand around her belly and pull her towards me and my lips grab those diamond-like lips the same way a diamantaire grabs the diamond in his equipment, I pull her tightly towards me and our lips start carving the romance and resonate our hearts, the intimacy was such I didn't realize when my one hand was on one of her breasts, She looked in my eyes and hugged me tightly and then kissed me on my cheeks like a mom give her child a kiss to peace him down. Till this moment I had not encountered myself, I was in the hangover of her love and beauty, but the moment I realized myself there, my presence in my environment not in the environment that she created, An environment where every object is utterly beautiful in its own and has a significance of it but it all fall apart the moment it comes in front of my conscious, my heart filled with some guilt and my whole mind clouded by clouds of " Low Self-esteem ", I lost in the deep darkness of guilt and shame, the guilt of doing injustice in name of love with her, I'm nowhere in the queue to deserve a beauty like her with such a pure heart that evil turn in good with a touch of her. She noticed that I was lost somewhere and she even asked why you are behaving so absently, I just smiled and tried to compensate for the moment, after that I didn't find the courage in my heart that make eye contact with her, I avoided eye contact with her every time during every conversation, then she holds my hand while we were going to the restaurant for a meal, and I feel like someone just put me self-love in my nerves, my eyes go bright, my heart was filled with courage, my heart was almost filled up, my eyes almost teared up,  like someone just accept me for forever, I looked back she was looking in my eyes with such respect, care and love that it felt like she is just feeling proud of having me in her life. I held her hand tightly and walked like a crowned king walking with her queen. We ate, We smiled, We talked and in the lift, I kissed her like I'm paying a token of gratitude to her. The whole rest day I was proudly sitting beside her holding her hand and glancing in each other eyes. 
Now tell me What I need, why should look for better in the world when I get the best. My search stopped the day she accepted me but I had fear of losing her cause I had no confidence in myself, I was guilty that I didn't deserve her but after three physical meetings, she made me the man who deserved her, she put that that confidence in me to accept that I can be loved,  the self-esteem who help me to overcome that guilt. She has no idea what she means to me, every inch of my body looks up to her, I will never let her go from my heart unless she asks for it, She is the Key. I will never judge her even if she leaves me, I will always stay devoted to her.

            <summary style="font-family: serif; text-align: left;" >Chapter 2: Aspects of Understanding and War of interests.
             </summary><br>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                I believe understanding is the foundation of any relationship but what sort of understanding and how much do we need to act according to understanding, I believe understanding is good but don't play smart cause you understand another person yet just for the sake of avoiding argument you are misusing this understanding, the moment you start playing smart you are disrespecting that trust and you taking this relationship to such a destiny where you need to give account for all of your smartness, and you may end up losing your partner, So never try to avoids arguments and little fights cause after every argument we realize how far our partner is from you, is this separation is coverable or not, and after every argument the mutual understanding increase as well love and trust.
                War of interests is something that I recently came across after she claimed that we have nothing in common, your tastes are different and mine are different, And I was like yes we have many things uncommon but the things we have in common are more than enough to entertain our lives and found a common ground to move forward enjoying with together and where I can explore your aspect of life and you mine. So there is a very simple way to explain it using a vein diagram, you all must be familiar with it. 
                <img src="C:\Users\aksha\OneDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll\IMG-20240206-WA0039.jpg" alt="portrait" width="500" height="300" ><br>
                We are two different people, who lived in different environments, lived with different people, our journey was different so obviously there are some uncommon grounds for interest and exploration, but our common interests and the feel that I feel around her is more than enough for me to live a happiest and joyful life with her and learning her aspect of life, and I benefitted from this before her arrival I was not able to fix in this gen z generation, I went into depth of substance where it gives some meaning to it, the truth,  alike enjoying the surface of anything love, music, movies, etc where nothing mean anything just shake of some pleasure. But after her arrival, I let myself into her interests and now I feel connected with Gen Z, it is not that bad and frankly I love her music taste but sometimes I don't tell her that I like the song you were listening to cause I'm afraid, last time when I said that she was like have some your identity, don't destroy it. Although we must allow ourselves to explore each other aspects she is very resistive, and the funniest thing is she is afraid of getting proven wrong, the moment you try to correct her she will take it like I'm trying to impose something on her, she never accepts that she was wrong about something. 
                So recently what happened I teased her by saying "Why do you hate me so much " and she took it to heart and cut the call, Later she came and said you don't understand me, I wanted to say a lot but I didn't. Understanding, yes I do understand you but I don't play smart with you to just avoid little arguments cause somewhere I feel that I did play smart with you at some point in time, every single time when you say that you don't trust me, A man is tasted only once.  I wish I could have argued and made you understand and eradicate this thought when it came to your mind but I think I played smart that day and now it is eating you and it's hurting you and me too. I explain to you why playing smart in relations is a bad thing, a living example, There was some argument happening between my uncle and aunt about a very stupid thing which was very obvious to everyone around her that she didn't like this kinda act but yet he chooses to do that, So I ask him, You can simply avoid this unnecessary argument by not doing the thing and at least don't let her know, one thing sure you are not doing something where some dark thoughts came in your mind, you are devoted to her only then he replied to me, never avoid these arguments, these are the one by which you can understand there is not much insecurity comes in your partners mind, how worse things are, She is feeling loved or not, cause life as come at the point where we hardly open for these kinda things, but in arguments, you can feel the pain and insecurity in words, in tears and you can heal those scars and fill those gaps time to time , if you keep avoiding arguments one day will come when you realise how far your partner gone from you and now you can't fill the gap even if you want , this is the death of bond. So in the end I just want to say, I understand you, which is why I'm here still fighting for you, I understand you that is why I never thought of leaving you, I understand that is why I am waiting for your call for every night, I understand you that I keep my all senses devoted to you, never ever thought of anyone, not a single time I cheated with my eyes, my thoughts, with my actions. This kind of devotion I have generated in myself for you.

            <summary style="font-family: serif; text-align: left;" >Chapter 3 : The education Policy effect on Natural Thinking of People
            </summary><br>
            <p>
                
                If we believe that the motive behind the education policy after independence was to create an inclusive environment between sets of communities, How it should be done? The first step is to narrate the history in such a way that foreign invaders more look like they were living alongside us and fighting for freedom, hiding the massacre and atrocities caused by them, and it was done in a very finite way. All wars that happened have shown in a way that it was a war to hold and win the forts which was king used to do. Magnify the '1850s events by giving them a common motive to fight against the Britishers. But does it equally affect all communities, No, due to appeasement politics minorities have been given special provisions to teach religious teachings. The only victim was a Hindu, he was uprooted from his roots, Every other community proudly follows their rituals and every other community has gone through their sacred textbook but on the other hand, Hindus are not even aware of what sacred books of Hinduism are. Let me share some glimpses of the Education Policy's effect on the Hindu Mind.
                " A Good Student Must be ready to speak on anything whatever someone asks " A professor instructed his class. He continued "Like if I ask you about the recently inaugurated Ram Temple, who can speak on it" She raised her hand,( This self-confidence and courage to speak before the class without hesitation is something which makes me proud of her and at the same time jealous too, cause I don't have that courage, Let me share an incident since we talking about courage and self-confidence, Recently Annamalai ji came to our campus for a lecture event, and I'm a die-hard follower of him, So I was sitting in the audience with my friends and there was a shortage of seats, many students and professor had to stay stand, and short after I saw one of my colleague who is part of organizing team too was coming straight to me, at first I thought she will ask me to stand with my friends from our seats so elders can sit in our place but she came and asked me "you want to ask any question to Annamalai", But I let go the only opportunity to interact with Him beacuse I didn't found courage in me. So you can clearly see my jealousy is justified), She Elobrate " After the struggle of 500 years this Temple is finally happening, in August 1990, the Babri masjid was demolished and now after an order of Supreme court this construction started and not a single state money is used every single penny is donated by people " and here professor very beautifully using liberal tactics make her feel guilty which she should be proud of by saying that " look in the name of faith how much people donated but in the same place if there was school going to construct no one would have been come forward " and this is where I bit disappointed with her when she replied, "yes sir, you are right, this is the case". This is the case" literally kargil' this is what you think, you who supposed to come from a clan who claim to be the lineage of Raghuwansh whose only dharma is to stand with dharma, justice and truth. Yet, you think this is merely because of faith. No, I don't think so cause if it is just a matter of faith only then why are there several ancient temples on the verge of dying, in my campus There is one Old temple Jalakanteswara Temple devoted to Lord Shiv, you know what recently we came across, we got to know that temple is running out of the fund that they are struggling to do even daily offerings to Lord, We intervene in this matter, wrote emails to concern able faculties and request them to contribute monthly so temple can survive, and many temples in Tamil Nadu itself are dying due to lack of funds and resources to renovate, In Kanchipuram which is one oldest city and a temple city, One priest is taking care for 4-5 temples so they all are subjects of faith then why people are not funding them. The Ram Temple is not just a matter of faith but a matter of dignity, a matter of truth and justice, and a matter of doing the right thing and this is why people all over India contribute 1 rupee,10 rupees according to their strength because people want to contribute in this truth, justice and in revival of dignity, people not only send money but bricks from all the villages of India send to Ayodhya and which was later used in the foundation of the temple.
                Today we come to a point where most of the person believe merit should be respected, this is what they believe not what they actually preach. What we most care is about the background story, for example, the headlines of the news after the board exam result announcement, burkha-clad girl scored 90 in the exam, x and y boy coming from economically bad family scores that and which make sense though after we look what actually merit according to you. So in the recent lecture event, the Same question was put in front of Annamalai ji, and we very beautifully explained it, he explained maybe a person scoring 99 is a merit candidate for you but for me, the person who scores 95 coming from a society or a place where only dream is to arrange daily meal somehow, and he pulls himself out of that and scores 95 is shows you the struggle, The heap of hurdles that he cross is what makes him a merit candidate, A Dalit making his/her position is parliament is something considerable, our honourable president the journey she had is something remarkable. But are we really following this definition of merit without any biases?  probably not what we do more care about is what sub-section someone coming from . Recently in UP , two girls scored well in a competitive exam, both had the same family grounds but the whole coverage was given to one particular girl just because she came from a particular sub-section of society, Biasness in human rights, A human got killed butchered every day in streets it doesn't make any news, no human rights come forward for him, but if the same common man comes from a particular section of society, every start talking about it. In a recent test match, three players played well but see the biases of our minds and our affinity, Jaiswal is the person who scored 99 and shares the same background which scored 95 in the prior example, Dhurv scored comparatively around 98 but yet he was not picked by society, if we look throughout the series they both are the reason because we win. But what people chose was "Sarfaraz Khan" who did good in only a single match in later he was a bad performer but the kind of hype we created, his father invited him to the commentary box, Anand Mahindra announced one Thar for him, and he got to on her Instagram story but they failed to do so. So what we can take away from it is we don't give a shit about merit but rather the story, As Shri Aurbindo ji said that Hindus are affected by "Chaksulaza" where they want to prove themselves good in everyone's eyes and for that, they can axe their own leg, they can stand against the truth, they can let go their dignity in it. We want to appease others than our own to get in their good books. 
                If someone puts me in a situation where I need to choose which is eviler according to you "Wahabism" or "Sufisim", I would choose Sufisim, because through they will not just convert you but they will make you brainwashed and you even don't realise because they use language of love to do that, they will make you say bad words for your own faith for example "chap tilak sab cheeni rh those naina millake" this song literally means that I removed the symbol of Hari and Shiva from my forehead after I counter you, ek tha Pritam masjid me ek thi sajjan mandir which literally promote love jihad, and haa hum hasi ban gaye that line "kha miltha hum kaafiro ko khuda" they will make you feel bad for your own faith and will make you hate your own roots. And believe me, you can't even actually make people understand about it they will tell you that you are wrong and you are spreading communal hatred, for God sake at least leave Art, but this is what we want to make you understand they didn't even spare art to propagate their nefarious purposes. So recently I was telling this all to her and the reaction was the same like at least leave art please, and I was like ok just tell me what is the meaning of Kafir? and I thought that she would probably answer that it means those who don't believe in god which is the sugar-coated meaning of it which came into existence after people started questioning Islam but she was even at worst, she said "the one who lost" and backed her answer with evidence that it was in their Hindi book in school and I just said ok, because she is this innocent that she believes everything comes in existence with good intension and how come art and literature comes with intention of evil, and I just felt let her believe this cause I too believe art must be spared, it must be pure and with good intention.
                So long story short, the moral is you don't need to prove something to someone , this will make your soul corrupt and after that you will more care about what everyone liking you or not rather than standing with truth or justice or right , it is not like you did something wrong , there is nothing wrong in it but what message which you are trying to portrait is unnecessary and you are encouraging something which should come at end, because this idea of "good in everyone eyes" will never let you stand with truth ,you either avoid truth or ally yourself with false.
